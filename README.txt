There are 2 formulations of the problem:

1) Regression 
2) Classification

To run the Machine Learning scripts, run "ML_regression.py" and "ML_classification.py". 

To run the Deep Learning scripts, run "DL_regression.py" and "DL_classification.py". 

Note that for regression in deep learning, I have trained the model on my system and saved the weights (.h5) which are now being loaded, so my results can be reproduced. If you want to do training your own system, you can uncomment the code and run it. However, there will be difference in results in that scenario as the weights are initialized randomly and may end up being different than the stated results.
